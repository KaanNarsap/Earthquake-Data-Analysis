This project aims to analyze and visualize global earthquake data using the Geological Survey Data Earthquake. By collecting, processing, and analyzing real-time and historical earthquake data, the project will explore seismic patterns such as earthquake frequency, magnitude distribution, depth variation, and geographical clustering. The outcome will be a set of visualizations that help understand global seismic activity and highlight regions of high seismic risk.

Data Collection:
  Retrieve earthquake data (magnitude, depth, location, time) from the USGS API for a defined time range (e.g., last 20 years or real-time).

Data Analysis:
 Analyze the distribution of earthquake magnitudes and depths.
    Investigate the frequency of seismic events over time.
    Identify geographic regions with a high occurrence of earthquakes.

Geospatial Visualization: Create interactive maps that display:
Earthquake locations overlaid on a world map.
    Regions with a high frequency of earthquakes.
    Patterns between earthquake depth and magnitude.

Temporal Visualization: 
  Show trends over time, such as changes in earthquake activity, and compare year-on-year seismic activity.
  
Seismic Risk Identification: 
Based on the analyzed data, identify and highlight areas that are most prone to high-magnitude earthquakes and assess potential seismic risk zones.
